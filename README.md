Ideas of what to cover:

- Basic overview of what you're looking at when you go to someone's github repo page (readme automatically displays, license info on right pane, can browse file structure, can download directly from there as a ZIP or 'clone' based on what you'll learn today (but see later for R packages on github)
- where to put the GitIgnore so it always works [link](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/02-ignore/index.html)
- idealized file structure for a repo and how to create it (maybe show both from github website and from computer), inc. raw data, derived data, scripts, output/plots, ideally with readme in each folder. If got raw data from someone else, indicate database version/download date/any requirements for reuse and licensing
- When to make repos public vs private/at what stage, pros and cons of each choice
- basic workflows e.g., pull, commit, push, revert, clone/fork etc. [link](https://happygitwithr.com/workflows-intro.html)
- another resource on cloning in RStudio that to me is less scary than the one above fork and clone subsection which is more focused on facilitating eventual pull requests [link](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-version-control/03-git-in-rstudio/index.html)
- why licenses are important [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) and how to choose [here](https://gist.github.com/nicolasdao/a7adda51f2f185e8d2700e1573d8a633)
- how to install packages from GitHub [here](https://www.displayr.com/installing-r-packages-from-github/)
- ggsave and write.csv 
- R projects and why they're useful (can discuss how you can use shorter file paths when plotting to plots folder, file paths become universal and not dependent on a particular working directory,  etc)
- file naming convention best practices
- crash course in clean coding best practices, inc. variable naming, commenting, adding R package version info
- Zenodo & creating DOIs? if time (highlight that it's free)
- OpenRefine to create reproducible workflow of data wrangling without as high a threshold for coding ability (note that survey respondents all indicatd a decent level of R skills)
- How you can get feedback on your repo without that person needing to know how to use github (browsing repo and emailing you comments, making an account and opening issues, enabling the discussions tab)
- GitHub pages intro (if time)
