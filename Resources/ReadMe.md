# Additional Resources for Workshop Attendees

Thoughts:

- Where to put the GitIgnore so it always works [link](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/02-ignore/index.html)

- Basic workflows e.g., pull, commit, push, revert, clone/fork etc. [link](https://happygitwithr.com/workflows-intro.html)

- Another resource on cloning in RStudio that to me is less scary than the one above fork and clone subsection which is more focused on facilitating eventual pull requests [link](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-version-control/03-git-in-rstudio/index.html)

- Why licenses are important [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) and how to choose [here](https://gist.github.com/nicolasdao/a7adda51f2f185e8d2700e1573d8a633)

- How to install packages from GitHub [here](https://www.displayr.com/installing-r-packages-from-github/)

- R projects and why they're useful [resource](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) OR [resource](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)

- Zenodo & creating DOIs (free) [link](https://zenodo.org/)

- OpenRefine to create reproducible workflow of data wrangling without as high a threshold for coding ability (note that survey respondents all indicatd a decent level of R skills) [link](https://openrefine.org/)

- Examples of clean code/naming conventions you can adopt to make your code more accessible [naming conventions](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/collect/file-naming-conventions) OR R for Datascience [link](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
